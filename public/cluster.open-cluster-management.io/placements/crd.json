Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters;\n 2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets;\n 3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces;\n 4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set\n    of potential ManagedClusters;\n 5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection.\n\n\nA ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement\nnamespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a\nManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual\nsubresource of `managedclustersets/bind`.\n\n\nA slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}\nwill be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement.\n\n\nIf a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may\napply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on\nthis ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.",
