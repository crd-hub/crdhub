In the\nfollowing resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:\n\n\n* Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\nare specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\nboth specified values.\n* Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\nare specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\nboth specified values.\n\n\nImplementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\nIf that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\ninterpreted.\n\n\nWhen unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\nFor the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\nleast one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\nlisteners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\nnamespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\nthe referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\nattached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\nRoute MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n\nSupport: Core",
