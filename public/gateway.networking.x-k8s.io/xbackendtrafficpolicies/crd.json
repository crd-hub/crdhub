This budget is calculated based on the percentage of incoming\ntraffic composed of retries over a given time interval. Once the budget\nis exceeded, additional retries will be rejected.\n\nFor example, if the retry budget interval is 10 seconds, there have been\n1000 active requests in the past 10 seconds, and the allowed percentage\nof requests that can be retried is 20% (the default), then 200 of those\nrequests may be composed of retries. Active requests will only be\nconsidered for the duration of the interval when calculating the retry\nbudget. Retrying the same original request multiple times within the\nretry budget interval will lead to each retry being counted towards\ncalculating the budget.\n\nConfiguring a RetryConstraint in BackendTrafficPolicy is compatible with\nHTTPRoute Retry settings for each HTTPRouteRule that targets the same\nbackend. While the HTTPRouteRule Retry stanza can specify whether a\nrequest will be retried, and the number of retry attempts each client\nmay perform, RetryConstraint helps prevent cascading failures such as\nretry storms during periods of consistent failures.\n\nAfter the retry budget has been exceeded, additional retries to the\nbackend MUST return a 503 response to the client.\n\nAdditional configurations for defining a constraint on retries MAY be\ndefined in the future.\n\nSupport: Extended",

Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\nuseful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\nSHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\nhave a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\nIn the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\nresource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\ntargets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\nPolicies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\nancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\nService may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\nimplementations.\n\nFor example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\nused as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\nIn this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\nancestor object referred to in this status.\n\nNote that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\nrelevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\nThis struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\nwith a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.",
